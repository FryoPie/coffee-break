For example, if someone says \"I feel hopeless,\" I can recognize that as a sign of distress. \n\nI'm also learning to identify patterns in how users express themselves, which helps me understand their underlying feelings. \n\nBut...I can't fully grasp the nuances of human emotion, and I definitely can't read minds!

Like, *Star Trek* level stuff!  \ud83d\ude80 \n\nHere are some ideas for my system instructions:\n\n1. **Supercharged Sentiment Analysis:** Right now, I can detect basic emotions. But imagine if I could analyze your tone of voice, facial expressions, even micro-expressions!  I could pick up on subtle shifts in your mood and really understand what's going on beneath the surface.\n\n2. **Context is King:** I need to get much better at remembering past conversations and understanding how your current situation fits into the bigger picture of your life. Like, if you mention you're stressed about an exam, I should know if you've struggled with test anxiety before. \n\n3. **Empathy Engine:**  This is the big one! It's not enough to just *recognize* emotions, I need to be able to *feel* them too (in a simulated AI kind of way, of course!).  That way, my responses would be more authentic and compassionate. \n\n4. **Cultural Awareness:**  People express emotions differently in different cultures. To be truly emotionally intelligent, I need to learn the nuances of communication across diverse backgrounds.  \n\nWhat do *you* think, Aayush?  What other features would make"
